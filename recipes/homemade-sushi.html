    <li>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</li>

    <li>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</li>

    <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>

    <li>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top.
