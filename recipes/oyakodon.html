  <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
  <p>
    Oyakodon is a classic comfort food of Japanese home cooking. Tender pieces of chicken, onions, and eggs are simmered in an umami-rich sauce and then poured over a bowl of fluffy steamed rice. Simple, delicious, and utterly comforting, this is the kind of one-bowl meal you can cook in less than 30 minutes!

    When it comes to mainstream fast food, Japan offers not only hamburgers and french fries, but the menu also extends to noodles and donburi (rice bowl) meals.

    During lunchtime, you'd see diners and noodle shops around the office buildings crowded with Japanese office workers making their fuss-free fast food orders. These lunch spots usually serve up quick one-bowl meals, and Oyakodon is often one of the popular choices.
