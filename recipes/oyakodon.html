  <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
  <!--First Paragraph-->
  <p>
    Oyakodon is a classic comfort food of Japanese home cooking. Tender pieces of chicken, onions, and eggs are simmered in an umami-rich sauce and then poured over a bowl of fluffy steamed rice. Simple, delicious, and utterly comforting, this is the kind of one-bowl meal you can cook in less than 30 minutes!    
  </p>
  <!--Second Paragraph-->
  <p>
    When it comes to mainstream fast food, Japan offers not only hamburgers and french fries, but the menu also extends to noodles and donburi (rice bowl) meals.
  </p>
  <!--Third Paragraph-->
  <p>
    During lunchtime, you'd see diners and noodle shops around the office buildings crowded with Japanese office workers making their fuss-free fast food orders. These lunch spots usually serve up quick one-bowl meals, and Oyakodon is often one of the popular choices.
